# OpenConnect-VPN-Server
Buggy script for configuring AnyConnect Server easily and automatically.

## Installation

Get the script on your server
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iw4p/OpenConnect-VPN-Server/master/ocserv-install.sh
chmod +x ocserv-install.sh
```

And then just run it:
```sh
./ocserv-install.sh
``` 

And one more thing, contributions are welcome.
